Hey, I'm Tom a Full Stack Web Developer currently studying for my Computer Science degree at the University of Kent. Currently I am working as a Software Engineer at [Holiday Extras](https://holidayextras.co.uk), working part time during my final year studies.

Im a strong believer in progressive enhancment, making sure that all users are able to use and interact with a system in the best way possible. If possible I try to avoid re-inventing the wheel, there are a number of great systems already available on the web using these can save time and money.

I have worked in the web industry for a number of years, prior to starting my degree I worked as a full stack developer for [Bright-Site](http://bright-site.co.uk), building a number of successful projects for clients.
