#### Brief

I was asked to build a e-Commerce solution that would allow Brodie Crafts to sell there custom hand made pens. It needed to work across multiple platforms, be fast and reliable.

#### What I did

I put together a bespoke e-Commerce mobile friendly site integrating with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as the CMS system and Stripe for secure payments. This provided a nice and easy to use system that allows them to easily update content and sell products online.

#### What They Thought

> " Tom has provided an elegant solution for our new company, we are so pleased with how the site has come out **10/10** "
