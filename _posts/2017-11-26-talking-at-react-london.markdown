Having attended React London for a number of meetups, I felt it was
time to pull my socks up and give my own talk. This was the first talk I
had done and although full of nerves, it was a great expereince to have. 

I based my talk on the advancments made in the latest version of React (16)
focusing primarly on the server side rendering improvments that have been made.
