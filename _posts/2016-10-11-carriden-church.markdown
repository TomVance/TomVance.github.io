#### Brief

I was asked to build a elegant looking website that would allow the church to communicate with it's congregation on a digital platform. They needed to advertise upcoming events and have a copy of the weekly newsletters.

#### What I did

The site was built using [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) which allowed them to easily manage the content on the website. It's responsive allowing church members to access the information they needed at anytime.

#### What They Thought

> " Outstanding, we have had great feedback from parish members. Tom has shown a clear understanding of our goals. Thankyou! "
